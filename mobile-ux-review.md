Assumptions: Review is based on repository source only (no live build); default theme is dark; mobile uses the bottom action bar plus drawers; feature flags are in their default state.

## Executive Summary
- Issue/Opportunity: Onboarding can be exited too easily and feels long; Recommended Fix: disable backdrop dismiss, add explicit "Skip for now" and "Resume later", and make progress/step count more prominent; Expected Impact: higher onboarding completion and activation rates.
- Issue/Opportunity: Spread selection carousel and locked spreads are easy to miss on mobile; Recommended Fix: add a visible "Swipe to explore" cue, arrow buttons, and a "Requires Plus" badge; Expected Impact: better spread discovery and higher upgrade conversion.
- Issue/Opportunity: Deck reveal and ritual interactions rely on hidden gestures and tiny targets; Recommended Fix: add a first-time gesture coach plus always-visible hint and a step-by-step reveal mode for large spreads; Expected Impact: fewer mis-taps, higher reveal completion, and less frustration.
- Issue/Opportunity: Primary actions are duplicated (action bar plus in-content) and some tap targets are small; Recommended Fix: make the bottom action bar the single primary CTA and enforce 44pt minimum hit areas; Expected Impact: clearer flow, faster task completion, and higher narrative generation/save rates.
- Issue/Opportunity: Guided Intention Coach feels dense for average users; Recommended Fix: introduce a "Basic" path and tuck templates/stats behind an "Advanced" drawer/tab; Expected Impact: more users finish the coach and submit higher-quality questions.
- Issue/Opportunity: Journal navigation and filters are hard to reach after deep scroll and use small type; Recommended Fix: add a floating "New Reading" action and increase filter/label sizes on mobile; Expected Impact: better return-to-reading behavior and higher journal engagement.

## Strengths and What to Preserve
- Cohesive mystical visual system (gradients, panels, iconography) that stays consistent across reading and journal.
- Mobile action bar with keyboard avoidance and safe-area awareness supports one-handed use.
- Personalization depth in onboarding (spread depth, tone, focus areas) is thoughtful and valuable.
- MobileInfoSection pattern and modal a11y hooks show strong accessibility intent.
- Narrative skeletons and service health banners provide good feedback for loading/fallback states.
- Journal insights and empty states are rich, instructive, and motivating.

## Detailed Findings and Fixes
- UX-1 - Location: Reading > Deck ritual and spread reveal (`src/components/DeckRitual.jsx`, `src/components/SpreadTable.jsx`); Issue Description: gesture-based ritual actions (double tap, long press) are not discoverable and small spread labels (0.55-0.65rem) make large spreads hard to tap and read on phones; Why It Is a Problem: discoverability and Fitts's Law issues reduce task success (iOS HIG/Material touch target guidance); Severity: High; Suggested Fix: add a first-time overlay that teaches gestures and keep a compact hint visible in landscape, plus a step-by-step reveal mode for spreads >5 cards (stacked list or zoomable spread); Effort (Estimate): High; Platform Notes: use haptic confirmations on both iOS and Android when gestures are recognized.
- UX-2 - Location: Spread selection carousel (`src/components/SpreadSelector.jsx`); Issue Description: horizontal scrolling and lock state are easy to miss, and selection auto-confirms without a clear "Next"; Why It Is a Problem: hidden navigation reduces discovery and confidence (Nielsen visibility and user control); Severity: Medium; Suggested Fix: add a swipe cue plus arrow controls and a "Requires Plus" badge, and consider a confirm CTA on mobile; Effort (Estimate): Low-Medium; Platform Notes: iOS can use subtle bounce and haptic on edge, Android use visible arrows.
- UX-3 - Location: Onboarding modal (`src/components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.jsx`); Issue Description: backdrop click skips onboarding and there is no explicit resume path; Why It Is a Problem: accidental exit increases drop-off and undermines first-time success; Severity: Medium; Suggested Fix: disable backdrop dismiss on mobile and add "Skip for now" plus "Resume later" or save-progress prompt; Effort (Estimate): Low; Platform Notes: intercept Android back to show a confirm dialog before exit.
- UX-4 - Location: Personalized reading plus quick intention (`src/components/ReadingDisplay.jsx`, `src/components/MobileActionBar.jsx`, `src/components/QuestionInput.jsx`, `src/components/QuickIntentionCard.jsx`); Issue Description: primary CTAs are duplicated (action bar and in-content), and some targets are below 44px (e.g., Save intention, Change deck link); Why It Is a Problem: weak visual hierarchy and small targets slow task completion (WCAG 2.5.8); Severity: Medium; Suggested Fix: keep the bottom action bar as the single primary CTA, convert in-content CTAs to secondary hints, and ensure all tap targets meet 44pt minimum; Effort (Estimate): Low; Platform Notes: test with VoiceOver/TalkBack focus order after changes.
- UX-5 - Location: Guided Intention Coach modal (`src/components/GuidedIntentionCoach.jsx`); Issue Description: templates, stats, suggestions, and quality tools compete in the same view, creating cognitive overload; Why It Is a Problem: Hick's Law and mobile cognitive load reduce completion; Severity: Medium; Suggested Fix: split into "Basic" and "Advanced" modes, showing only the 3-step coach plus final question in the default path; Effort (Estimate): Medium; Platform Notes: ensure the Android system back closes advanced panels before exiting the modal.
- UX-6 - Location: Journal history and filters (`src/components/Journal.jsx`, `src/components/JournalFilters.jsx`); Issue Description: "Back to Reading" is only at top, and mobile labels/badges use very small type (10-11px); Why It Is a Problem: navigation friction and reduced readability for average users; Severity: Medium; Suggested Fix: add a floating "New Reading" or "Back to Reading" action and raise label sizes to 12-14px in the compact filter view; Effort (Estimate): Medium; Platform Notes: anchor floating actions above safe-area insets.

## Prioritized Roadmap
Phase 1 (Now / High Impact, Low-Medium Effort): onboarding dismiss change, spread carousel cues and locked badges, CTA hierarchy cleanup, and 44pt tap-target fixes.
Phase 2 (Soon / High Impact, Higher Effort): guided coach simplification, quick settings inside the mobile drawer, journal floating "New Reading" action, and mobile label size adjustments.
Phase 3 (Nice-to-Have / Long Term): step-by-step reveal or zoomable spreads for large layouts, plus landscape guidance refinements.
