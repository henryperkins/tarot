## Questionable Cards (Not Installed)

### From IMG_0440.JPG (4 cards)

❓ **These cards have labeling inconsistencies with Thoth naming:**

1. **Card labeled "THE FOOL"** (0)
   - Thoth uses "The Fool" ✓
   - Artwork style questionable but could be valid

2. **Card labeled "THE HIGH PRIESTESS"** (II)
   - ⚠️ Thoth calls this "**THE PRIESTESS**" not "THE HIGH PRIESTESS"
   - Labeling suggests RWS or hybrid deck

3. **Card labeled "DEATH"** (XIII)
   - Thoth uses "Death" ✓
   - But artwork style questionable

4. **Card labeled "TEMPERANCE"** (XIV)
   - ⚠️ Thoth calls this "**ART**" not "TEMPERANCE"
   - This is RWS naming, not Thoth
   - **Conflicts** with confirmed Art card from IMG_0438

**Assessment**: IMG_0440 appears to be from a **different deck** (likely Rider-Waite-Smith or a hybrid deck with Thoth-style artwork but RWS names).

**Recommendation**: Do not use these cards. Photograph authentic Thoth versions instead.

## Photography Guide

### Setup Tips
- **Lighting**: Diffused natural light or soft LED (avoid glare/shadows)
- **Background**: Dark matte surface (black or charcoal gray)
- **Layout**: 4-5 cards per photo (horizontal row) works well
- **Distance**: Fill frame while keeping 5-10px margins
- **Focus**: Sharp, clear, no blur
- **Format**: JPG or PNG, any resolution (will be auto-resized)

### Naming Convention
Upload with any name (e.g., `IMG_XXXX.JPG`). The extraction script will handle splitting and renaming.

### Batch Recommendations
To minimize photos needed:

**Batch 1 - Remaining Major Arcana (7 cards)**
- Photo 1: The Fool, The Priestess, Adjustment, The Hermit (4 cards)
- Photo 2: Death, The Devil, The Moon (3 cards)

**Batch 2 - Minor Arcana by Suit (56 cards)**
- Wands: 3-4 photos (14 cards)
- Cups: 3-4 photos (14 cards)
- Swords: 3-4 photos (14 cards)
- Disks: 3-4 photos (14 cards)

**Total**: ~16-18 photos to complete the full 78-card deck

4. Run extraction script: `python3 scripts/assets/splice_card_photos_simple.py`

### Option B: Hybrid Approach
- Keep real scans for the 15 Major Arcana cards
- Continue using enhanced placeholders for remaining 63 cards
- Accept moderate accuracy (50-60%) for non-scanned cards

### Option C: Use Enhanced Placeholders Only
- Revert to placeholders: `cp public/images/cards/thoth-placeholders-backup/*.png public/images/cards/thoth/`
- Accept moderate accuracy (~60%) across all cards
- No copyright concerns, 100% legal

## Legal Reminder

**Copyright Status**: Thoth deck artwork is © Lady Frieda Harris / OTO. Using personal scans for **personal use** is generally acceptable under fair use, but **public distribution** of scanned images may violate copyright.

**Before Public Deployment**:
- Consider whether to use scans or placeholders in production
- Review copyright implications for your jurisdiction
- Consider hybrid approach (placeholders public, scans optional upload)
