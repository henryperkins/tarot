# Frontend & Mobile UX Review

## Findings
- **Missing preparation entry point (src/TarotReading.jsx:587-721; src/components/MobileActionBar.jsx:233-259):** On sub-640px screens the full `ReadingPreparation` panel is hidden and only reachable through the tiny gear button inside the mobile action bar. First-time visitors scroll through spreads without ever seeing the question/audio/ritual controls, so they default to shuffling immediately. Auto-open the drawer the first time the step indicator highlights “Set your intention” or surface a compact inline question card before the drawer is discovered.
- **Heavy spread artwork (src/components/SpreadSelector.jsx:10-122; src/components/SpreadPatternThumbnail.jsx:16-33; src/styles/tarot.css:423-500):** Each spread tile loads a 4096×4096 PNG hero image with layered gradients and glows. The carousel therefore pulls tens of MBs and causes GPU thrash on mid-range phones. Replace the art with responsive WebP/WebM sources (e.g., 768/1280 widths via `srcset`), mark as `loading="lazy"`, and tone down the nested shadows to keep scroll smooth.
- **Share UI context loss (src/pages/ShareReading.jsx:254-354):** Mobile share links collapse into two tabs (“Spread” vs “Notes”). When users switch to notes the spread disappears entirely, so collaborators can’t see the layout they’re commenting on and the scroll position resets. Consider an always-visible mini spread preview above the form or a split view so context stays on screen.
- **Hidden carousel affordances (src/components/ReadingGrid.jsx:155-420; src/styles/tarot.css:603-626):** The reading grid hides scrollbars and dismisses its “Swipe to explore cards” hint after 4 seconds. Keyboard and screen-reader users are left without any indication that more cards exist horizontally. Keep a persistent helper chip, expose the horizontal scrollbar, or announce via `aria-describedby` that the region scrolls sideways.
- **Layered visual effects hurting FPS (src/styles/tarot.css:199-217, 361-500, 1234-1305):** The mobile action bar, spread cards, and drawers combine multiple `backdrop-filter`, `radial-gradient`, and `box-shadow` layers. These look great on desktop but drop frames on phones, especially while the action bar animates to avoid the keyboard. Provide reduced-transparency tokens for mobile, or gate the heaviest effects behind `prefers-reduced-motion`/`prefers-reduced-transparency` so scrolling stays fluid.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Prototype a “first visit” mobile drawer auto-open (plus inline question summary) and track whether intention completion rates improve.
2. Generate responsive spread artwork, measure bundle weight and FID on throttled mobile, and trim layered glows once replacements land.
