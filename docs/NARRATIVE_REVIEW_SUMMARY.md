# Narrative Builder & Prompt Engineering Review - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2026-01-21  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot Code Review Agent  
**Repository:** henryperkins/tarot  
**Files Analyzed:** 7,562 lines of code

## TL;DR

The narrative builder and prompt engineering system is **functionally excellent** but needs **technical debt reduction**. System is production-ready but requires refactoring for long-term sustainability.

**Grade:** B+ (83/100)

---

## Status Update (Current Main)

- Crisis detection now runs before spread analysis (`functions/api/tarot-reading.js`).
- Prompt safety truncation now fails fast via `truncateSystemPromptSafely` (`functions/lib/narrative/prompts/truncation.js`), and the orchestrator catches `PROMPT_SAFETY_BUDGET_EXCEEDED`.
- `sanitizePromptValue` strips template syntax (`functions/lib/narrative/helpers.js`).
- Spread builders include input guards via the base spread fallback (`functions/lib/narrative/spreads/base.js`).
- `functions/lib/narrative/prompts.js` is a barrel; prompt modules total 2,429 LOC and `helpers.js` remains ~1,682 LOC.
- Vision proof is optional; mismatches are logged for research telemetry but do not block readings.

---

## Key Findings

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Sophisticated Architecture**
   - Layered pipeline with clear stages
   - Token budgeting with conservative estimation
   - GraphRAG integration for contextual passages
   - A/B testing framework
   - Comprehensive observability

2. **Safety-First Design**
   - Crisis detection for mental health signals
   - Input sanitization
   - Quality gates for narrative validation
   - Ethical guidelines enforcement

3. **Flexible Backend Selection**
   - Azure GPT-5 → Claude → Local fallback
   - Provider-specific prompt variants
   - Streaming support

### ⚠️ Issues Found

#### Critical (Must Fix)

1. **File Size Explosion** 🔴
   - `prompts/` modules: 2,429 lines total; `prompts.js` is a 4-line barrel
   - `helpers.js`: 1,682 lines
   - Hard to maintain and test

2. **Performance Waste** 🔴 (resolved)
   - Crisis detection now runs before spread analysis

3. **Global State** 🔴
   - `PROSE_MODE` flag vulnerable to cross-request bleed
   - Legacy test helper pattern

4. **Safety Gap** 🔴 (resolved)
   - Token truncation now fails fast when critical sections exceed 80% budget

#### Security Concerns

5. **Prompt Injection Risk** ⚠️ (resolved)
   - `sanitizePromptValue()` strips template syntax (`{{}}`, `${}`, `<% %>`, `{% %}`, `{# #}`)

6. **Vision Proof Handling** ⚠️
   - Vision proof is optional; mismatches are logged for research telemetry and do not block readings

7. **Input Validation Scattered** ⚠️ (partially addressed)
   - Spread builders now guard against malformed input; remaining validation should be centralized

#### Maintainability

8. **Code Duplication** 📝
   - Spread builders repeat opening/closing logic
   - 30-40% LOC reduction possible

9. **Inconsistent Error Responses** 📝
   - HTTP status codes vary: 400/409/422/429/503
   - No documented error matrix

10. **Incomplete Features** 📝
    - Reasoning integration half-implemented
    - Optional features not truly optional

   - Readings saved from analysis

2. **Token Budget Issues**
   - PROMPT_SAFETY_BUDGET_EXCEEDED frequency
   - Sections affected by truncation

3. **Input Validation**
   - NARRATIVE_NO_CARDS frequency
   - Card count mismatches

4. **Security**
   - Template injection attempts
   - Vision proof mismatches

### Alerting Thresholds

- **Critical:** Safety budget exceeded > 5/hour
- **Warning:** Crisis detection > 1% of requests
- **Info:** Token truncation > 10% of requests

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Changes
- ✅ Crisis detection timing (straightforward refactor)
- ✅ Safety budget fail-fast (error handling)
- ✅ Template syntax filtering (string operations)
- ✅ Input guards (validation logic)

### Medium Risk Changes
- ⚠️ File refactoring (requires thorough testing)
- ⚠️ Global state removal (affects tests)
- ⚠️ Base class extraction (inheritance patterns)

### High Risk Changes
- ❌ Plugin architecture (major refactor)
- ❌ Backend routing changes (affects all readings)

**Recommendation:** Start with low-risk changes to build confidence.
