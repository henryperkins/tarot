TABLEU: WHERE TAROT MEETS SCHOLARSHIP

Tableu is not another random card generator. It's a structured self-reflection system built on decades of tarot scholarship and modern knowledge graph technology.

▸ RITUAL-BASED DRAWS
Unlike apps that use random shuffles, Tableu creates deterministic draws from your personal ritual: knock timing, cut position, and question combine into a unique seed. Same ritual, same cards—your engagement shapes the reading.

▸ KNOWLEDGE GRAPH INTELLIGENCE
Powered by GraphRAG (Graph-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Tableu retrieves curated passages from authoritative tarot sources—Pollack, Greer, Place, Golden Dawn teachings—to inform every interpretation.

▸ ARCHETYPAL PATTERN DETECTION
• Fool's Journey Mapping: Recognizes which developmental stage your cards represent
• Archetypal Triads: Detects powerful 3-card combinations (Healing Arc, Liberation Arc, Mastery Arc)
• Elemental Dignities: Analyzes card relationships based on traditional correspondences

▸ MULTI-DECK PHYSICAL CARD RECOGNITION
Use your own physical cards. Tableu's vision AI recognizes three deck traditions:
• Rider-Waite-Smith (1909)
• Thoth (Crowley-Harris) with epithets and decan astrology
• Marseille with numerology themes

▸ LONG-TERM JOURNEY TRACKING
Track recurring cards and patterns over weeks and months. Receive alerts when archetypes reappear. Earn badges as you deepen your practice.

▸ SIX SPREADS FOR EVERY QUESTION
• One-Card Insight: Quick daily guidance
• Three-Card Story: Past, present, future
• Five-Card Clarity: Core, challenge, hidden, support, direction
• Decision/Two-Path: Compare options with agency
• Relationship Snapshot: You, them, connection
• Celtic Cross: Classic 10-card deep dive

▸ ETHICAL DESIGN
Tableu emphasizes agency, not destiny. Readings use "likely path if unchanged" language. Professional boundaries are maintained—no medical, legal, or financial advice.

—

This is tarot as a tool for structured introspection, not supernatural prediction. If you're seeking slot-machine randomness and vague fortunes, look elsewhere. If you want scholarly depth and meaningful self-reflection, welcome to Tableu.

## Review Notes for Apple (App Store Connect)

```
Dear Review Team,

Tableu differs fundamentally from existing tarot apps through several novel technologies:

1. DETERMINISTIC RITUAL SYSTEM: Unlike random shuffles, draws are seeded by user ritual input (knock timing + cut position + question hash), making them reproducible and meaningful.

2. GRAPHRAG KNOWLEDGE RETRIEVAL: AI interpretations are augmented with curated passages from tarot scholarship (Pollack, Greer, Place, Golden Dawn), not generic LLM output.

3. ARCHETYPAL PATTERN DETECTION: The app automatically identifies Fool's Journey stages, archetypal triads (e.g., Death-Temperance-Star "Healing Arc"), and elemental dignities between cards.

4. MULTI-DECK VISION AI: Users can photograph physical cards from three deck traditions (RWS, Thoth, Marseille) with deck-specific interpretation.

5. LONG-TERM JOURNEY TRACKING: Unlike session-based competitors, Tableu tracks patterns across readings over months, surfacing recurring archetypes.

These features represent genuine innovation not found in any existing App Store tarot application. We respectfully request reconsideration under Guideline 4.3(b).
