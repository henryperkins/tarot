**Root Causes**
- Stream disconnected warnings: the provider stream dropped mid-turn; Codex treats `CodexErr::Stream` as retryable and logs the reconnect loop with backoff (`/home/azureuser/codex/codex-rs/core/src/codex.rs:2928`, `/home/azureuser/codex/codex-rs/core/src/error.rs:70`, `/home/azureuser/codex/codex-rs/core/src/api_bridge.rs:24`). Root cause is upstream stream interruption (Azure/network), not a local tool failure.
- Function call output missing warnings: history normalization found a FunctionCall without a matching output and injected a synthetic `"aborted"` output (`/home/azureuser/codex/codex-rs/core/src/context_manager/normalize.rs:26`). Root cause is that the tool output never made it into the response items (typically because the stream disconnected or the tool flow was aborted).
- The two `sed` tool calls into `codex.rs`: those are instances of the same missing-output path; the tool call was emitted, but its output was not recorded, so the normalizer logged the warning and inserted `"aborted"` (`/home/azureuser/codex/codex-rs/core/src/context_manager/normalize.rs:26`).
- Session resume/config logs are normal startup state: rollout resumed from an existing JSONL (`/home/azureuser/codex/codex-rs/core/src/rollout/recorder.rs:254`), provider set from session config (`/home/azureuser/codex/codex-rs/core/src/codex.rs:588`), managed config missing because `/etc/codex/managed_config.toml` is absent (`/home/azureuser/codex/codex-rs/core/src/config_loader/layer_io.rs:85`), exec policy found no rule files (`/home/azureuser/codex/codex-rs/core/src/exec_policy.rs:258`), and the MCP web-fetch server started (`/home/azureuser/codex/web-fetch-mcp/src/index.ts:695`).
- The final “Focus on just rhe most recent” + `tail -n 120` tool call + missing output warning: expected user input → tool call; missing output means the tool result wasn’t added to response items, so normalization inserted `"aborted"` (`/home/azureuser/codex/codex-rs/core/src/context_manager/normalize.rs:26`).

If you want deeper attribution, I can:
1) Correlate the call IDs with the rollout JSONL to confirm whether tool outputs were ever recorded.
2) Scan the log for request IDs around the disconnects to help tie this to Azure-side telemetry.
