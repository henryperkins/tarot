**Findings**
- Medium: Heuristic fallback scores on async eval errors aren’t promoted to `evalPayload.scores` or `eval_mode='heuristic'`, so `overall_score`/`safety_flag` stay null and quality stats/alerts treat these as errors instead of usable fallback data. `functions/lib/evaluation.js#L999`, `functions/lib/evaluation.js#L1007`, `functions/lib/evaluation.js#L1054`
- Medium: High‑weight position coverage check compares `missingCards` (built from canonical names) against `card.card` (raw name). For Thoth/Marseille aliases this can miss a high‑weight omission and let a low‑coverage reading pass the quality gate. `functions/api/tarot-reading.js#L995`, `functions/lib/readingQuality.js#L620`
- Low: When the eval gate is disabled, `runSyncEvaluationGate` returns a skip reason (`eval_disabled`/`gate_disabled`), but metrics store `evalGate.ran: true` with a null reason, so telemetry shows “ran” without the skip cause. `functions/lib/evaluation.js#L1155`, `functions/api/tarot-reading.js#L297`
- Low: `docs/evaluation-system.md` is out of sync with current implementation (model references, prompt version, cost basis). E.g., it still mentions “Llama 3 8B” and `EVAL_PROMPT_VERSION = '1.0.0'` while code uses `gpt-oss-120b` and `2.1.0`. `docs/evaluation-system.md#L27`, `docs/evaluation-system.md#L155`, `functions/lib/evaluation.js#L10`

**Open Questions / Assumptions**
- Do you want heuristic fallback on async eval errors to be treated as `eval_mode='heuristic'` with scores persisted (so alerts/analysis keep working during evaluator outages)?
- Should the high‑weight coverage check use `card.canonicalName` (or canonical key) instead of `card.card` to keep gating consistent across deck styles?
- Is it acceptable for `evalGate.ran` to be true when the gate is disabled, or should we propagate the skip reason into `evalGate.reason`?

**Overview**
- Pre‑accept quality gate: Each backend attempt is validated with structural narrative metrics (card coverage, hallucinated cards, spine completion, high‑weight positions). Failing backends are rejected before a reading is accepted. `functions/api/tarot-reading.js#L973`, `functions/lib/readingQuality.js#L567`
- Evaluation gate (sync): When `EVAL_ENABLED` + `EVAL_GATE_ENABLED`, a Workers AI evaluator scores personalization/tarot coherence/tone/safety/overall and blocks on `safety_flag`, `safety<2`, or `tone<2`. If blocked, a safe fallback replaces the reading. Failure mode can be open/closed with heuristic safety fallback. `functions/lib/evaluation.js#L1144`, `functions/api/tarot-reading.js#L151`
- Streaming safety: If token streaming is allowed, output is buffered to enforce the eval gate, or (when the gate is off) a heuristic safety scan can still block unsafe output. `functions/api/tarot-reading.js#L794`
- Prompt evaluation process: `runEvaluation` builds a rubric‑driven prompt including spread, cards, user question, and structural metrics; parses JSON; clamps scores; attaches prompt version metadata. Heuristic fallback detects safety/tone risks via pattern scans (medical/financial/death/self‑harm/violence/abuse/doom). `functions/lib/evaluation.js#L405`, `functions/lib/evaluation.js#L1294`
- Improvement loop: Metrics are stored in D1 (`eval_metrics`) with redaction/minimal modes; daily cron computes aggregates and regression alerts; offline scripts export eval data and calibrate score distributions and A/B variant performance. `functions/lib/readingQuality.js#L950`, `functions/lib/qualityAnalysis.js#L23`, `functions/lib/scheduled.js#L1`, `scripts/evaluation/calibrateEval.js#L1`
- Additional narrative telemetry: GraphRAG injection/trim stats and alerts, prompt slimming steps, enhancement telemetry, usage tokens, and optional prompt‑engineering hashes/PII‑redacted prompts for analysis. `functions/lib/readingTelemetry.js#L180`, `functions/lib/graphRAGAlerts.js#L1`, `functions/lib/promptEngineering.js#L382`
- Vision research metrics (optional): proof‑of‑vision insights are sanitized and summarized (confidence, mismatches, symbol stats) for research telemetry, not gating. `functions/api/tarot-reading.js#L526`, `functions/lib/readingQuality.js#L915`

No tests run. If you want fixes for the findings, I can propose patches + tests next.
